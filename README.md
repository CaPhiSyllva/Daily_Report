# Daily_Report
This script sends a daily email report at 06:00 AM using `smtplib` and `schedule`. It emails from `email@domain.com` to `recipient@domain.com` with a subject including the current date and a predefined body. Email settings (SMTP server, port, user, password) are configured, and the script runs continuously, checking every minute.
